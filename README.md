# [Weather Scraper Project](http://christianpenaalba.com/projects/weather-scraper-project/index.php)
This project was built using PHP and Ajax. I use HTML/CSS for the front end, then Ajax to send the data to PHP. PHP then takes the user input and checks weather.com for the result. This project was from a course in [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/).

## Getting Started
Enter a city and you will know what the weather is like.

## Creator
Weather Scraper Project was created by **Christian Pena** with the help with Udemy Course.
